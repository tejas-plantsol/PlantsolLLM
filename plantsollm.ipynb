We cannot accomplish alone what we can \\naccomplish together.  \\nWith that in mind, I am pleased to present our Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2019  – 2023. This plan sets our course for safeguarding  the health, welfare, and value of \\nAmerican agriculture and natural resources over  the next five years. We will accomplish the \\nplan’s goals by delivering our programs and services efficiently, effectively, with integrity, and a strong focus on customer service.  \\nAPHIS  takes  the appropriate measures to protect agricultural health by preventing and \\nmitigating the spread of plant and animal pests and diseases, and to enable safe  agricultural \\ntrade  to ensure the prosperity of U.S. producers and the growth of the economy.  We will \\nimprove the customer experience by modernizing and consolidating our information \\ntechnology infrastructure, as well as other structures  and services  throughout the agency.  We \\nwill seek innovat ive solutions to best serve the needs of our customers. We will streamline our \\nprocesses and reduce regulatory burdens. We will carefully and responsibly manage our \\nresources and use accurate and reliable data to make decisions and to maximize our return on \\ninvestments  and deliver value to our customers . \\nAPHIS will maintain a high performing workforce by maximizing employee performance and \\nproviding safe work environments. We will keep employees engaged and empowered because \\nemployees who  are passionate about their work have a positive effect on the quality of the \\nagency’s products and services. We will also leverage the diversity of our workforce to create a more inclusive and fair work environment . \\nIn the coming years, this plan will guide our work to ensure our efforts meet the needs and expectations of our customers and the American public . We will remain accountable to each \\nother and to the people who rely on our services. Together, we wi ll meet the goals and  \\nobjectives set forth in this plan.  \\n  \\n \\nKevin Shea, Administrator USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  \\n  \\n2 \\n Mission  \\nTo safeguard the health , welfare  and value of American agriculture  and natural resources . \\nCore Values  \\nThe USDA’s S trategic Plan for fiscal years (FYs) 2019– 2023 identifies the Department’s core \\nvalues. As part of the USDA, APHIS  embraces the same values, thereby contributing to the \\nsucces s of the Department as a whole.  \\nThe success of USDA depends on  the following core values:  \\n\\uf076 Honesty & Integrity  – We expect a nd require complete honesty and integrity in all we do.  \\n\\uf076 Commitment  – We make commitments with care and live up to them.  \\n\\uf076 Accountability  – We own up to problems and are always responsive.  \\n\\uf076 Reliability  – We provide service to our customers on time, every time.  \\n\\uf076 Responsible Stewardship  – We guard, conserve, and preserve USDA resources the \\ntaxpayers have entrusted to us.  \\nDriving Forces  \\nAgriculture and the global marketplace continue to evolve , and A PHIS must progress and \\nchange to keep pace. The driving forc es below require that we take a critical look at how we \\nstrategically conduct our activities  to best meet our mission . While some of these driving forces \\nare predictable and  have become e stablished over time, other forces , such as the changing pest \\nand diseas e landscape  are less  predictable  and present more uncertainties.  \\n  \\n3 \\n A Closer Look at the Driving Forces  \\nDeliver ing Services with a Customer Focus  \\nToday, customers  expect more transparent, accessible, and responsive services from the public \\nsector . While the public sector has made changes in recent years to improve the delivery of \\nservices, more can be done. According to a recent survey conducted by the McKinsey Center for \\nGovernment, customers feel frustrated by cumbersome websites and processes, and dealing \\nwith multiple parties before their needs are met. In addition to traditional customers, the public sector must also be prepared to meet the needs of new and less traditional customers. For example, the growth of nontraditional producers in rece nt years  has required  APHIS to expand \\nits services to cover additional  species,  and new  production methods and practices . With this in \\nmind, we will seek out opportunities to engage with our customers so we can better understand their needs  and gather feed back on our services . This will include reaching out to \\nunderserved communities, socially disadvantaged  farmers, ranchers, and tribes. We will focus  \\non being more efficient and effective . We will base our decisions on robust and timely analysis \\nof data to better meet the needs of our customers . For a number of APHIS programs, our \\ncustomers and stakeholders may have differing viewpoints, and we value th ese differences . \\nEngaging partners, stakeholders, and customers  including the regulated community  with \\ndiffering viewpoints is important in managing the risks associated with program operations and \\npolicymaking.  \\nGlobal Demand for U.S. Agricultural Products  \\nExpanding international marketing opportunities for U.S. farmers and exporters is crucial to business and income growth across rural America. In fact , today the U.S. farmers  export more \\nthan 20  percent  of what they produce, and support more than 1 million jobs in communities \\nacross the country for ranchers, growers, truckers, brokers, dockworkers, an d other agricultural \\nbusinesses. APHIS contributes to this robust export market by providing technical and scientific expertise to animal and plant health issues, and by preventing and resolving barriers to U.S. food and agricultural exports. This scientif ic and technical know -how is vital to the success of \\nthose that negotiate, monitor, and enforce trade agreements. Without it, the task of retaining or expanding foreign markets would be more challenging than it already is, given the unpredictability of the  trade arena. APHIS plays a crucial role in helping prevent or mitigate \\nmarket disruptions for U.S. producers and foreign consumers.  \\nEnsuring Protection is at a Reasonable Cost  \\nAPHIS is dedicated to protecting the health, welfare, and value of American agriculture and natural resources. At the same time, APHIS understands this protection should be at a reasonable cost. With this understanding, APHIS is committed to easing regulatory burdens on the American people. E asing regulatory burdens makes it easier t o create jobs and promote \\neconomic growth. Agriculture and commerce operations have changed over the years, and the regulatory tools that worked in the past may not be the best tools to use today. We need to go beyond regulations and seek out other means for safeguarding animal and plant health, and  \\nanimal welfare. We will continue to work closely with our partners, stakeholder, and customers to explore alternatives to regulations. This may include employing outreach initiatives or leveraging industry stand ards. We will look at flexible approaches to apply to existing 4 \\n regulations and identify older regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, ineffective, and no \\nlonger suppor ted by science or sound policy.  \\nRapid Advances in Science and Technology  \\nRapid advances in science and technology provide APHIS with opportunities to continually change how we provide services to our customers. This includes adapting our current practices and adopting new best practices. Communications and commerce occur electronically —hard -\\ncopy forms are quickly becoming obsolete. Plant and animal sciences are changing quickly with developments in the areas of genetic engineering, disease detection and veterinary biologics, \\namong others. Other developing technologies, including  unmanned aerial systems (drones) are \\nincreasingly utilized by the public and private sectors to increase efficiencies in surveys and \\nmonitoring. Like USDA’s initiative to provide faster, friendlier and easier service to its \\ncustomers, APHIS too is committ ed to making it easier and faster for customers to find the \\ninformation they need. With an eye toward excellence, value, and the future, we are always \\nfinding new ways to accomplish our work so that APHIS’ way of doing business reflects the way agricult ure and commerce operate today.  We use more technology to ensure industry moves at \\nthe speed of commerce and keeps up with demand for agricultural commodities. Our science centers will lead the way by developing and delivering science -based knowledge and meth ods \\nto identify and analyze risks and mitigate threats. Along with traditional communication tools such as publications and public service announcements, we also use new technologies to reach our partners, stakeholders, and customers.  \\nChanging Pest and Dis ease Landscape  \\nToday, the landscape for pests and diseases is changing. Pest and disease events are more \\nfrequent, more complex, and less predictable. These changes are occurring for many reasons, \\nincluding human population growth, urbanization, economic d evelopment, changes in land use, \\nincrease s in global travel and trade, and changing farming and production practices. These \\nglobal developments are contributing to the worldwide redistribution of pathogens, vectors, and infected hosts. Examples of recent global emerging disease events include the Middle East \\nrespiratory syndrome outbreak in 2012, the H7N9 avian influenza outbreak in China in 2013 , \\nthe Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) outbreak in the United States in 2014, the H5 N2 \\navian influenza outb reak in the United States in 2015,  and the Zika virus outbreak in 2016.  \\nMany of these events involve zoonotic diseases with the potential to impact human health and that require s new partnerships with experts in public health, wildlife, and the environmen t. It is \\nessential that APHIS adapts to this changing landscape by preventing the entry and spread of these pests and diseases in the United States and by strengthening its early detection, preparedness, and response capabilities. APHIS will employ an inte grated systems- based One \\nHealth approach , which focus on the interconnection between people, animals, plants and the \\nenvironment , to minimize the risk of pest and disease events, to protect the national food \\nsupply.  \\n  5 \\n Goals and Objectives  \\nTo respond to these driving forces, APHIS needs to be faster and more agile to meet the needs \\nof our partners, stakeholders  and customers . APHIS will constantly strive to improve and deliver \\nour services in a way that is less costly , faster, and more effec tive for American agriculture, \\nfarmers and ranchers, and the public.  \\nTo accomplish our mission, our goals are to:  \\n• Deliver efficient, effective, and responsive programs . \\n• Safeguard American agriculture . \\n• Facilitate safe U.S. agricultural exports . \\nThese three  strategic goals represent our overall priorities. The y include 14 objectives that \\ncompr ise the agency’s major programmatic efforts and services . To support the objectives of \\neach goal, APHIS employs numerous proven tactics in the programs.  The tactics in this plan \\nrepresent  only a portion of APHIS activities  and by no means embody all the important work \\nAPHIS does to fulfill  its mission.  \\nGoal 1.   Deliver efficient, effective, and responsive programs  \\nAPHIS  delivers  efficient, effective, and responsive programs, with integrity and a focus on \\ncustomer service.  APHIS will improve the customer experience by modernizing and \\nconsolidating IT systems and services, strengthening facility and property management, and \\nstreamlining business practices an d processes to better serve customers. APHIS will investigat e \\nand incorporat e big data tools to enhance research and statistical analyses, as well as support \\nfuture data systems investments to create efficiencies  and enhance decision -making . \\nAPHIS will also remove obstacles in its  programs by reducing regulatory burdens. APHIS will \\nsafeguard the health, welfare, and value of domestic agriculture and natural resources, but will ensure this effort is at a reasonable costs to American producers. APHIS will also maximize the return on taxpayer investments by conserving resources and being accountable for the spending of these resources. To improve its program delivery, the agency will expand use of \\nperformance data and program evaluations to drive its decisions. Information resulting from \\nthese evaluations will help the agency to identify areas of improvement to improve the quality of services providing by APHIS programs. Additionally, APHIS will embrace  workforce  \\ndifferences to better serve its cus tomers.

Safeguard American agriculture  \\nAmerican agriculture faces many threats from foreign and domestic pests and diseases, which \\nhave  the potential to negativ ely impact  animal and plant agricultural production, trade , and the \\neconomy . Identifying these threats early enables APHIS  to anticipate potential outbreaks and to \\nact appropriately to prevent entry and prolonged damage  if there is an incursion . Because \\nthese threats are ever -changing, APHIS adjusts it strategies for identifying these  pests and \\ndiseases and applying appropriate mitigation  measures . \\nBy working collaboratively with its stakeholders and partners, APHIS maintain s the capacity and \\ncapa bility to rapidly respond to an agricultural pest or disease outbreak. APHIS also actively \\nengages other Federal agencies, State, Tribal, local governments, and industry to advance their \\nemergency preparedness and response capabilities. If a pest or diseas e is established in the \\ncountry, APHIS works with its stakeholders and partners to eradicate the pest or disease, or \\nwhere eradication is not feasible, to manage the pest or disease, minimizing its impact to the economy.  9 \\n APHIS also manages damage or other conflicts cause d by wildlife, detects and controls wildlife \\ndiseases, and protects natural resources. APHIS will continue to ensure the safety, purity, and \\neffectiveness of veterinary biologics and provide oversight of genetically engineered organisms. APH IS also conducts diagnostic laboratory activities to support the agency’s veterinary disease \\nprevention, detection, control, and eradication programs, and provides technology development to support plant protection programs. The agency will also conduct pr ogram \\noperations to ensure the humane care and treatment of vulnerable animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act and the Horse Protection Act.  \\nAPHIS  must balance its safeguarding efforts against increasing requests for market access by \\ninternational trading partners for agricultural products.
